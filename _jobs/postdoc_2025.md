### About the Position
I am seeking an enthusiastic Postdoctoral Research Fellow to make a decisive contribution to our research in robot learning at [QUTâ€™s Centre for Robotics (QCR)](http://www.qcr.ai). This is a unique opportunity to join one of Australiaâ€™s leading robotics groups and play a key role in a nationally significant research collaboration.

As part of the [ARIAM Research Hub](http://www.ariamhub.com), youâ€™ll work closely with me, our vibrant QCR team of academics, engineers, and PhD students, and expert colleagues from USyd (control) and ANU (planning). Together, we are pushing the boundaries of learning from demonstration, aiming to tackle key challenges in sample efficiency and generalisation.

I am looking to fill this position **immediately** (from September 2025). Please [contact me](#how-to-apply) if you are interested.

### Position Details
 * Type: Full-time, fixed-term (24 months)
 * Level: Academic Level B
 * Salary: Starting from $114,000 AUD  with annual increments, + 17% superannuation
 * Leave: 20 days annual leave + paid personal/sick leave
 * Location: QUT Gardens Point campus, Brisbane, Australia


### The Research Vision
This project is about rethinking how robots learn from humans. We're especially interested in:
 * Learning from very few demonstrations
 * Generalising to new tasks, objects, and environments
 * Combining imitation learning with insights from control, planning, scene understanding, and LLM-driven reasoning

Youâ€™ll have the chance to do pioneering work with many real robots (stationary single and dual-arm setups, as well as mobile manipulators) and shape the future of robot learning in the context of infrastructure robotics and beyond.

Youâ€™ll also gain insights into research group management, including milestone tracking, budget planning, and broader research leadership â€“ ideal preparation for an independent research career.

For a sample of our work in this area, check out our recent papers:

 * Actively participate in the QCR and ARIAM communities, including events in Brisbane, Sydney, and Canberra
 * Co-supervise PhD and undergraduate students
 * Contribute to QCRâ€™s Visual Learning and Understanding research program
 * Support a collaborative and inclusive research culture in Australia through visits and joint publications

### Selection Criteria
 * Completion of a PhD in robotics or a related field
 * A clear research agenda and the demonstrated ability to conduct independent, high-quality research
 * Track record of publication in top robotics, ML, or vision venues
 * Deep expertise in robotics, machine learning, or computer vision
 * Proficiency in Python, PyTorch, and general software development on Linux
 * Experience working with robot hardware: arms, mobile bases, cameras, other sensors
 * Excellent written and verbal communication skills

### How to Apply
To apply, please email the following materials to ðŸ“§ niko.suenderhauf@qut.edu.au
 * A short video introducing yourself, your previous work, and your research vision for the next two years
 * Your CV, including a full list of publications
 * A motivation letter and research plan (max 3 pages)
 * A statement on how you meet the selection criteria above (max 2 pages)
 * A statement on how you plan to meet the key responsibilities above (max 2 pages)
 * Contact details for 1â€“2 referees, or attach reference letters

### About the Visual Learning and Understanding Program
The Research Fellow will be a key member of QCRâ€™s Visual Learning and Understanding Program.

This program investigates the fundamental problem of how a robot can learn to reliably interpret its environment, and build an internal representation of its surroundings in order to decide on its actions. The program addresses research questions such as how machine learning for visual perception can be made safe, trustworthy, and reliable; how robots can understand and represent the geometry, semantics, and functionality of their surroundings and the task-relevant objects therein; and how robots can use this internal representation and learn to decide or plan their next actions in order to accomplish a useful task in a safe way.


### Type of Appointment
This appointment will be offered on a fixed term, full-time basis for **12 months** with a potential option for extension.

### Remuneration and Benefits
This Research Fellow position is classified as Academic Level B (LEVB) which has an annual salary of **$104,290 AUD to $123,858 AUD, plus 17% superannuation**.

QUT is a high quality and flexible organisation that is proud of its excellent employment conditions which include but are not limited to:
 * Reduced working year scheme
 * Parental leave provisions
 * Study support encompassing leave and financial assistance
 * Comprehensive professional development
 * Salary Packaging

### Location
Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Gardens Point campus, Brisbane, Australia.
We are located on a beautiful campus next to the Brisbane City Botanic Gardens, just a few minutes on foot from the Brisbane CBD and the bustling Southbank cultural precinct with many fantastic restaurants and bars. QUT has excellent connections to public transport, including our CityCat river ferry, trains, and bus lines. A bike path along the river connects QUT with the nearby suburbs.

Brisbane is a very liveable sub-tropical city of 2.3M people and offers great opportunities for recreational activities ranging from hiking in the many nearby national parks, rock climbing (the Kangaroo Point crag is just across the river, and there are many of well-maintained sport crags in a 1-2 hour radius around Brisbane, as well as a selection of climbing and bouldering gyms in the city), surfing (the famous Gold Coast is just over one hour away), and all things beach and ocean related. -->
