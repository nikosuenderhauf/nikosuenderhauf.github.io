Our application to establish the **Australian Research Council Research Hub in Intelligent Robotic Systems for Real-Time Asset Management** has been successful! In this 5 year project we will develop new robotic capabilities to transform the way infrastructure and assets are inspected, managed, and maintained. This is a joint project with the University of Sydney, the Australian National University in Canberra, and many partners from industry. I will serve as Deputy Director (Research), and look forward to working with new colleagues and old friends!
