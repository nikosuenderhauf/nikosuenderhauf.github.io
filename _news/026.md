If you want to start your PhD with me in 2025, apply now for a scholarship! I have PhD topics available in [Robotic Learning](../projects/learningtonavigate.md), combining Imitation Learning with Large Language and Vision-Language Models and innovative ways to represent the environment. These projects will build on our recent successful work such as [SayPlan](https://sayplan.github.io/) or [ParticleNeRF](https://sites.google.com/view/particlenerf). Read here for [more information](../../jobs).
