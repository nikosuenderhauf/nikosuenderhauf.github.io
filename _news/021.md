My application for promotion to **Professor** has been successful! Only two years after becoming Associate Professor, this appreciation by QUT is very much owed to the immense support by my colleagues in our [QUT Centre for Robotics](www.qcr.ai), the School for Electrical Engineering and Robotics, and my collaborators at QUT, in Australia, and internationally!
