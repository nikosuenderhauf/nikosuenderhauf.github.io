title: Reliability of Deep Learning for Robotics
description:
---


Despite the enormous progress of deep learning over the past decade, and the appearance of foundation models such as large language models or vision-language models in the past few years, questions about their reliability and robustnes remain. How do deep learning models react when presented with out-of-distribution data? How can they express the uncertainty in their predictions, and know when they don't know? Are recent foundation models immune to open-set or out-of-distribution conditions?

These questions are of enormous importance if we want to apply deep learning (and AI in general) to safety-critical applications where mistakes could have catastrophic consequences.

Our research tackles critical challenges like open-set recognition, out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, and failure identification in visual perception.
