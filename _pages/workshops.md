[**Good Citizens of Robotics Research**](https://sites.google.com/view/rss20-gcr) (**RSS 2020**)
This workshop provided a forum for discussions and commentary on topics about research, dissemination, and community, by taking inspiration from Computer Vision research and [this excellent CVPR workshop](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~parikh/citizenofcvpr/). We discussed important questions like: How to incentivize and do good systems research? How to best disseminate results, code, and hardware? How to be a fair reviewer? How to be a good area chair? How to support a caring and inclusive community? How to bridge the gap between academia and industry and the role of ethics in their interplay? and in general how to go about being a good citizen of robotics research.

[**New Frontiers for Deep Learning in Robotics**](http://juxi.net/workshop/deep-learning-rss-2017/) (RSS 2017)

A wide range of renowned experts discussed deep learning techniques at the frontier of research that are not yet widely adopted, discussed, or well-known in our community. We carefully selected research topics such as Bayesian deep learning, generative models, or deep reinforcement learning for planning and navigation that are of high relevance and potentially groundbreaking for robotic perception, learning, and control. The workshop introduces these techniques to the robotics audience, but also exposes participants from the machine learning community to real-world problems encountered by robotics researchers that apply deep learning in their research.

Invited speakers: Yann LeCun (Facebook, NYU),  Yarin Gal (University of Cambridge), Josh Tenenbaum (MIT), David Cox (Harvard), Chelsea Finn (UC Berkeley), Piotr Mirowski (DeepMind), Aaron Courville (Université de Montréal).

Organised with the support of Jürgen Leitner, Michael Milford, Peter Corke (QUT, Brisbane), and Pieter Abbeel (UC Berkeley).

[**Deep Learning for Robotic Vision**](http://juxi.net/workshop/deep-learning-robotic-vision-cvpr-2017/) (CVPR 2017)

Recent advances in deep learning techniques have made impressive progress in many areas of computer vision, including classification, detection, and segmentation. While all of these areas are relevant to robotics applications, robotics also presents many unique challenges which require new approaches.

Robotic vision specific challenges include the need for real-time analysis, the need for accurate 3d understanding of scenes, and the difficulty of doing experiments at scale. There are also opportunities robotics brings to computer vision, for example the ability to control position and viewing direction of the camera, and to provide a data source for "grounded" learning of concepts, reducing the need for manual labeling.

Invited speakers: Jitendra Malik (UC Berkeley), Raquel Urtasun (U Toronto / Uber ATG), Dieter Fox (U Washington), Honglak Lee (Google Brain / U Michigan), Abhinav Gupta (CMU), Jianxiong Xiao (AutoX), Richard Newcombe (Facebook), Raia Hadsell (Google DeepMind), Ashutosh Saxena (Brain of Things).

Organised with support from Jürgen Leitner, Michael Milford, Ben Upcroft, Peter Corke (QUT, Brisbane), Pieter Abbeel (UC Berkeley), Wolfram Burgard (Uni Freiburg).

[**Are the Sceptics Right? - Limits and Potentials of Deep Learning in Robotics**](http://juxi.net/workshop/deep-learning-rss-2016/) (RSS 2016)

We analysed why deep learning has not yet had the huge impact in robotics it had in neighboring research disciplines, and especially in computer vision. The workshop will identify the limits and potentials of current deep learning techniques in robotics, and will propose directions for future research to overcome those limits and realize the promising potentials.

Invited speakers: John Leonard (MIT), Larry Jackel (North C Technologies), Dieter Fox (Washington University), Oliver Brock (TU Berlin), Pieter Abbeel (UC Berkeley), Walter Scheirer (University of Notre Dame), Raia Hadsell (Google DeepMind), Ashutosh Saxena (Cornell and Stanford University).

Co-organisers were Jürgen Leitner, Michael Milford, Ben Upcroft, Peter Corke (QUT, Brisbane), Pieter Abbeel (UC Berkeley), Wolfram Burgard (Uni Freiburg).

[**Visual Place Recognition in Changing Environments**](http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/etit/proaut/ICRAWorkshopChangingEnvironments) (ICRA 2014)

Organised with Peter Corke and Michael Milford (QUT, Brisbane).
We discussed novel concepts and ideas for robust vision-based place recognition in severely changing environments. Such changes – induced e.g. by the time of day, weather or seasonal effects as well as human activity – are a ubiquitous challenge for all autonomous systems aiming at long-term operations in both indoor and outdoor settings.

We had 9 contributed papers, a tutorial given by Peter, and invited talks by Michael and Paul Newman.

[**Robust and Multimodal Inference in Factor Graphs**](http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/etit/proaut/ICRAWorkshopFactorGraphs) (ICRA 2013

This full-day workshop brought together researchers working on novel approaches for modelling and inference in factor graphs. The goal of the workshop was to discuss techniques that introduce a larger robustness and allow incorporating multi-modal Gaussian or non-Gaussian measurements. New concepts of how to infere multi-modal posteriors were also in the scope of the workshop, as well as novel applications beyond the ubiquitous pose graph SLAM.
I organised this workshop with John Leonard (MIT CSAIL) and Edwin Olson (University of Michigan)
