[**New Benchmarks, Metrics, and Competitions for Robotic Learning**](https://sites.google.com/view/rss2018-robotic-learning/home) (RSS 2018)

 Similar in scope and topic to the CVPR workshop, here we discussed new benchmarks, competitions, and performance metrics that address the specific challenges arising when deploying (deep) learning in robotics.

[**Real-World Challenges and New Benchmarks for Deep Learning in Robotic Vision**](https://sites.google.com/view/cvpr2018-robotic-vision) (CVPR 2018)

In this workshop we discussed crucial challenges arising when deploying deep learning methods in real-world robotic applications, and a set of future large scale robotic vision benchmarks to address the critical challenges for robotic perception that are not yet covered by existing computer vision and robotics benchmarks, such as performance in open-set conditions, incremental learning with low-shot techniques, Bayesian optimisation, active learning, and active vision.

[**New Frontiers for Deep Learning in Robotics**](http://juxi.net/workshop/deep-learning-rss-2017/) (RSS 2017)

A wide range of renowned experts discussed deep learning techniques at the frontier of research that are not yet widely adopted, discussed, or well-known in our community. We carefully selected research topics such as Bayesian deep learning, generative models, or deep reinforcement learning for planning and navigation that are of high relevance and potentially groundbreaking for robotic perception, learning, and control. The workshop introduces these techniques to the robotics audience, but also exposes participants from the machine learning community to real-world problems encountered by robotics researchers that apply deep learning in their research.

Invited speakers: Yann LeCun (Facebook, NYU),  Yarin Gal (University of Cambridge), Josh Tenenbaum (MIT), David Cox (Harvard), Chelsea Finn (UC Berkeley), Piotr Mirowski (DeepMind), Aaron Courville (Université de Montréal).

Organised with the support of Jürgen Leitner, Michael Milford, Peter Corke (QUT, Brisbane), and Pieter Abbeel (UC Berkeley).

[**Deep Learning for Robotic Vision**](http://juxi.net/workshop/deep-learning-robotic-vision-cvpr-2017/) (CVPR 2017)

Recent advances in deep learning techniques have made impressive progress in many areas of computer vision, including classification, detection, and segmentation. While all of these areas are relevant to robotics applications, robotics also presents many unique challenges which require new approaches.

Robotic vision specific challenges include the need for real-time analysis, the need for accurate 3d understanding of scenes, and the difficulty of doing experiments at scale. There are also opportunities robotics brings to computer vision, for example the ability to control position and viewing direction of the camera, and to provide a data source for "grounded" learning of concepts, reducing the need for manual labeling.

Invited speakers: Jitendra Malik (UC Berkeley), Raquel Urtasun (U Toronto / Uber ATG), Dieter Fox (U Washington), Honglak Lee (Google Brain / U Michigan), Abhinav Gupta (CMU), Jianxiong Xiao (AutoX), Richard Newcombe (Facebook), Raia Hadsell (Google DeepMind), Ashutosh Saxena (Brain of Things).

Organised with support from Jürgen Leitner, Michael Milford, Ben Upcroft, Peter Corke (QUT, Brisbane), Pieter Abbeel (UC Berkeley), Wolfram Burgard (Uni Freiburg).

[**Are the Sceptics Right? - Limits and Potentials of Deep Learning in Robotics**](http://juxi.net/workshop/deep-learning-rss-2016/) (RSS 2016)

We analysed why deep learning has not yet had the huge impact in robotics it had in neighboring research disciplines, and especially in computer vision. The workshop will identify the limits and potentials of current deep learning techniques in robotics, and will propose directions for future research to overcome those limits and realize the promising potentials.

Invited speakers: John Leonard (MIT), Larry Jackel (North C Technologies), Dieter Fox (Washington University), Oliver Brock (TU Berlin), Pieter Abbeel (UC Berkeley), Walter Scheirer (University of Notre Dame), Raia Hadsell (Google DeepMind), Ashutosh Saxena (Cornell and Stanford University).

Co-organisers were Jürgen Leitner, Michael Milford, Ben Upcroft, Peter Corke (QUT, Brisbane), Pieter Abbeel (UC Berkeley), Wolfram Burgard (Uni Freiburg).

[**Visual Place Recognition: What is it good for?**](http://tinyurl.com/vprice-RSS16) (RSS 2016)

This half-day workshop, co-organised with Ben Upcroft, Michael Milford (QUT, Brisbane), and Peer Neubert (TU Chemnitz), focussed on concepts and ideas for robust vision‐based place recognition in severely changing environments as well as discussing the extent to which place recognition is useful, or even required for robots.

[**Visual Place Recognition in Changing Environments**](http://www.tinyurl.com/vprice-ICRA15) (ICRA 2015)

This half-day workshop at ICRA 2015 in Seattle built on the highly successful 2014 workshop of the same name at ICRA, and discussed novel concepts and ideas for robust vision-based place recognition in severely changing environments. Organised with Peter Corke and Michael Milford.

Around 130 people followed the invited talks and paper presentations in a large ballroom.

[**Visual Place Recognition in Changing Environments**](http://www.tinyurl.com/vprice-cvpr15) (CVPR 2015)

This workshop continued the discussion from the previous year at ICRA and addressed the computer vision community at CVPR. Organised with Peter Corke and Michael Milford (QUT, Brisbane), and Torsten Sattler (ETH Zürich).

Approximately 40 people came by for talks and poster presentations. It was great to interact with the authors and of course the invited speakers Josef Sivic and John Leonard at CVPR as well as David Cox and Chi Hay Tong at ICRA. Thanks everybody for contributing!

[**Visual Place Recognition in Changing Environments**](http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/etit/proaut/ICRAWorkshopChangingEnvironments) (ICRA 2014)

Organised with Peter Corke and Michael Milford (QUT, Brisbane).
We discussed novel concepts and ideas for robust vision-based place recognition in severely changing environments. Such changes – induced e.g. by the time of day, weather or seasonal effects as well as human activity – are a ubiquitous challenge for all autonomous systems aiming at long-term operations in both indoor and outdoor settings.

We had 9 contributed papers, a tutorial given by Peter, and invited talks by Michael and Paul Newman.

[**Robust and Multimodal Inference in Factor Graphs**](http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/etit/proaut/ICRAWorkshopFactorGraphs) (ICRA 2013

This full-day workshop brought together researchers working on novel approaches for modelling and inference in factor graphs. The goal of the workshop was to discuss techniques that introduce a larger robustness and allow incorporating multi-modal Gaussian or non-Gaussian measurements. New concepts of how to infere multi-modal posteriors were also in the scope of the workshop, as well as novel applications beyond the ubiquitous pose graph SLAM.
I organised this workshop with John Leonard (MIT CSAIL) and Edwin Olson (University of Michigan)
