After graduating with a Master's degree in computer science (German "Diplom-Informatiker") from [Chemnitz University of Technology](http://www.tu-chemnitz.de) in Germany in 2006, I obtained my PhD degree at the chair of [Automation Technology](https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/etit/proaut/en/index.html) at TU Chemnitz, supervised by [Prof. Peter Protzel](https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/etit/proaut/en/team/peterProtzel.html) in April 2012. For my [PhD thesis](http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:ch1-qucosa-86443) I focused on robust graph-based models for SLAM and probabilistic estimation.

After two more years as a postdoc in Chemnitz I joined the Robotics and Autonomous Systems [Group](https://research.qut.edu.au/ras/) at at Queensland University of Technology ([QUT](http://www.qut.edu.au)) in Brisbane in March 2014. In August 2014 I became a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the [Australian Centre for Robotic Vision](http://www.roboticvision.org) at QUT.

I joined the faculty at QUT in 2017 as a Lecturer (roughly equivalent to a tenured Assistant Professor position in the US system) and have been promoted to [Senior Lecturer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_lecturer) in 2018 and to Associate Professor in 2020. I was appointed Chief Investigator of the Australian Centre for Robotic Vision in 2018. Since 2020 I am Chief Investigator, Program Leader, and member of the Executive Committee of the QUT Centre for Robotics. In 2022 I was promoted to full Professor and became Deputy Director (Research) of the ARC-funded [Industrial Transformation Research Hub ARIAM](https://ariamhub.com/). In 2023 I became Deputy Director of QUT's Centre for Robotics.

I conduct research in robotic vision, at the intersection of robotics, computer vision, and machine learning. My research interests focus on [robot learning](../_projects/learningtonavigate.md) for manipulation, planning and naviation, as well as [scene understanding](../_projects/sceneunderstanding.md).
I regularly organise [workshops](../workshops) at robotics and computer vision conferences, such as RSS, CVPR, and ICRA.

#### Reviews and Community Service

I served on the **Editorial Board** for the International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR) from 2019 to 2022 and was IEEE **Technical Committee co-chair** for Computer and Robot Vision.
Between 2015 and 2019 I was **Associate Editor** for the IEEE [Robotics and Automation Letters journal](http://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/ra-l) (RA-L), and served as an AE for the IEEE [International Conference on Robotics and Automation](http://www.icra2018.org) (ICRA) in 2017/18. I have been serving regularly as a **reviewer** for the major journals (IJRR, TRO, RAS, IJFR) and major conferences (RSS, CoRL, ICRA, IROS, FSR, Intelligent Vehicles Symposium) in our field for many years.

I regularly serve as an **Assessor** for the Australian Research Council (ARC) and provide expert reviews since 2016.

I was coordinating **guest editor** for a special issue of the International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR) on the topic of Deep Learning in Robotics, published in 2018. I am guest editor for a special issue of the International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV) on the topic of Deep Learning for Robotic Vision, published in 2020.
