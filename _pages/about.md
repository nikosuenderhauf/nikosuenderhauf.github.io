I am a Professor and Chief Investigator of the [QUT Centre for Robotics](https://research.qut.edu.au/qcr/) at Queensland University of Technology ([QUT](http://www.qut.edu.au)) in [Brisbane](http://www.lensaloft.com.au/Interactive_tour/BrisbaneDusk/Brisbane.html), Australia, where I lead the Visual Understanding and Learning Program. 

I am Deputy Director (Research) for the ARC Research Hub in [Intelligent Robotic Systems for Real-Time Asset Management](www.ariamhub.com) (2022-2027). I was Chief Investigator of the [Australian Centre for Robotic Vision](http://www.roboticvision.org) 2017-2020.

I conduct [research](projects) in robotic vision, at the intersection of robotics, computer vision, and machine learning. My research interests focus on scene understanding, object-based [semantic SLAM](http://www.semanticslam.ai), robotic learning for navigation and interaction, uncertainty and reliability of deep learning in open set conditions. I furthermore lead a project on [new benchmarking challenges in robotic vision](http://www.roboticvisionchallenge.org).

I am very honoured that my work was recognised through a Google Faculty Research Award (2018) and an Amazon Research Award (2020).

I regularly organise [workshops](workshops) at robotics and computer vision conferences, such as RSS, CVPR, and ICRA. I am member of the editorial board for the International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR), and co-chair of the Technical Committee on Computer and Roboti Vision of IEEE the Robotics and Automation Society.  I was Associate Editor for the IEEE [Robotics and Automation Letters journal](http://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/ra-l) (RA-L) from 2015 to 2019, and served as AE for the IEEE [International Conference on Robotics and Automation](http://www.icra2018.org) (ICRA) 2018 and 2020.
